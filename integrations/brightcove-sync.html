    <p>If you upload large numbers of videos to HapYak using the Brightcove plugin, you may be interested in enabling Brightcove Sync on your account.
      <br>
      <br>By default, HapYak Projects autocreated through the Brightcove plugin will have the same title as the Brightcove video title
      <i>when the project was autocreated</i> and will have no thumbnail image. However, users are able to ensure that the HapYak project title and thumbnail are updated to match either the title or thumbnail image of the video in Brightcove.
    </p>
    <p>Syncing your Brightcove and HapYak accounts will add thumbnail images to any Brightcove videos present in your HapYak account that don't already have them. It's a huge time saver, especially when creating playlists in HapYak Experiences.</p>

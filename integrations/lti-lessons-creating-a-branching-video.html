    <p>Branching or Choose-Your-Own-Adventure is a popular type of interactive video. In a nutshell, it brings a viewer to different parts of a video, or new video entirely, based on how they interact with it.</p>
    <p>You can read more on the basics of Branching

    </p>
    <p>If you created a Lesson via HapYak's LTI integration you can do branching in two ways.</p>
    <h2 id="in-video-branching">In-Video Branching</h2>
    <p>You do
      <b>In-Video branching</b> just as you would in a single project in the HapYak portal. Detail

    </p>
    <h2 id="video-to-video-branching">Video to Video Branching</h2>
    <p>You can branch from video to video by following this technique.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Create a lesson.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create a second lesson (the next video where you'd like the viewer to branch to)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>View the second lesson as a student. Copy the URL of that lesson.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Go back to the first lesson. Add an annotation (text, hotspot or image) that the viewer would click to branch to the next video. In
          <a href="/annotations/link-options.html" data-is-internal-link="true">Link (ON CLICK EVENT)</a> / Load external URL:, paste the URL to the second lesson. Click Submit. Click Done.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Test by viewing this first lesson as a student. Clicking on the annotation should load the second lesson.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <i>Note: You can use this same technique in a Quiz annotation by adding the second lesson URL to the</i>
      <a href="/annotations/quiz-annotation.html" data-is-internal-link="true">Pass/Fail actions</a>
      <i> field.</i>

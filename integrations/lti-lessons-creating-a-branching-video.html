    <p>Branching or Choose-Your-Own-Adventure is a popular type of interactive video. In a nutshell, it brings a viewer to different parts of a video, or new video entirely, based on how they interact with it. You can read more on the basics of Branching <a href="/projects/branching-choose-your-own-adventure-video.html" data-is-internal-link="true">here</a>. </p>
    <p>If you created a Lesson via HapYak's LTI integration you can do branching in two ways.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="in-video-branching">In-Video Branching</h2>
    <p>You do <b>In-Video branching</b> just as you would in a single project in the HapYak portal. Detail <a href="/projects/branching-choose-your-own-adventure-video.html" data-is-internal-link="true">here</a>. </p>

    <h2 id="video-to-video-branching">Video to Video Branching</h2>
    <p>You can branch from video to video by following this technique.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Create a lesson. </li>
      <li>Create a second lesson (the next video where you'd like the viewer to branch to). </li>
      <li>View the second lesson as a student. Copy the URL of that lesson. </li>
      <li>Go back to the first lesson. Add an annotation (text, hotspot or image) that the viewer would click to branch to the next video. In <a href="/annotations/link-options.html" data-is-internal-link="true">Link (ON CLICK EVENT)</a> / Load external URL:, paste the URL to the second lesson. Click Submit. Click Done. </li>
      <li>Test by viewing this first lesson as a student. Clicking on the annotation should load the second lesson. </li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You can use this same technique in a Quiz annotation by adding the second lesson URL to the <a href="/annotations/adding-quiz-annotation.html" data-is-internal-link="true">Pass/Fail actions</a> field.</aside>

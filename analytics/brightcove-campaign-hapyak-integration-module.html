      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td>Link</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Chapters</td>

    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
    <p>Brightcove Audience allows tracking of custom properties for Metrics (numbers) named: metric1, metric2 and metric3 as well as custom properties for Events(strings) named: event1, event2 and event3.</p>
    <p>Brightcove Interactivity data is recorded in the custom properties as per the table below.</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <thead class="bcls-table__head">
        <tr>
          <th>Property</th>

    <h2 id="reports">How to create reports</h2>
    <h3>Where does the data show up in Brightcove Audience?</h3>
    <p>Data can be accessed in Video Cloud Studio by opening the Campaign module and then by selecting <strong>Export Campign Data</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/analytics/campaign-nav.png" /></figure>
    <p>Choose to export the data in CSV or Excel format. You will then be able to generate interaction reports by analyzing the data locally in a spreadsheet.</p>
    <h3>What reports can I create with the data?</h3>
    <p>You will be able to create reports that calculate what percentage of play session performed the desired action: clicking a link, navigating within the video, or submitting a response to an in-video question. The three core interaction reports are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click Through Rate</li>
      <li>Navigation Rate</li>
      <li>Response Rate</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interaction rate formulae</h3>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td width="240">Click Through Rate</td>
          <td width="330">Link / Play * 100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Navigation Rate</td>
          <td>Navigation / Play * 100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Response Rate</td>
          <td>Answer / Play * 100</td>

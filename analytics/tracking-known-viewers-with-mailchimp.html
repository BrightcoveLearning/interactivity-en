    <p class="intercom-align-left">Here's a great trick to pass in known viewer information from an email campaign in MailChimp.
      <br>
      <br>When you add a link to the interactive video in MailChimp, add query parameters to the end that reference the MailChimp merge tags.
      <br>
      <br>That will automatically identify who is watching the video to HapYak analytics.
      <br>
      <br>Here's an example:
      <br>
      <code>http://corp.hapyak.com/let-your-role-define-your-goal/?hapyak_userId=*|EMAIL|*&amp;hapyak_first=*|FNAME|*</code>&nbsp;
    </p>

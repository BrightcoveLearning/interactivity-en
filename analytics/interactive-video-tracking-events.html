    <p>At HapYak, we track how your viewers are interacting with your video in detail. More than just play and pause, we track a whole set of specific events associated with your video that give you deep-level insights into viewer choices, behavior and engagement. </p>

<p>There are three event types:</p>
    <ol>
          <li><strong>Player Action</strong> details how a viewer played, paused, and progressed through the video.</li>
          <li><strong>Annotation View</strong> and <strong>Annotation Ended</strong> details which annotations were seen by the viewer and for how long.</li>
          <li><strong>Annotation Action</strong> details how the user interacted with the annotation.</li>
          </ol>
      <p>Each event has a set of properties associated with it. For example, the event of a click on an annotation call-to-action could have the following properties:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The viewer’s <strong>UserID</strong> was “kyle_morton”</li>
          <li>The annotation’s <strong>duration</strong> was 8.35 seconds</li>
          <li>5 seconds <strong>elapsed</strong> before the viewer clicked the link</li>
          <li>The annotation’s link <strong>target</strong> was <code>http://www.rei.com/product/763713</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>HapYak passes the following interactions to Brightcove Campaign for tracking:</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td>Link</td>
          <td>Recorded every time a link in the video is clicked</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Navigation</td>
          <td>Recorded every time a Chapter, or Jump-to-time link in the video is clicked</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Chapters</td>
          <td>Recorded every time a Chapter marker is viewed (no interaction required)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Answer</td>
          <td>Recorded every time a question answer is submitted</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
    <p>Brightcove Audience allows tracking of custom properties for Metrics (numbers) named: metric1, metric2 and metric3 as well as custom properties for Events(strings) named: event1, event2 and event3.</p>
    <p>HapYak data is recorded in the custom properties as per the table below.</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <thead class="bcls-table__head">
        <tr>
          <th>Property</th>
          <th>What HapYak Sends</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td>metric1</td>
          <td>Total number of Links clicked during the play session</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>metric2</td>
          <td>Total number of Chapters clicked during the play session </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>metric3</td>
          <td>Total number of Questions answered during the play session </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>event2</td>
          <td>The names of the Chapters clicked (or viewed) during the play session, as comma separated values </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>event3</td>

    <h2 id="reports">How to create reports</h2>
    <h3>Where does the data show up in Brightcove Audience?</h3>
    <p>Data can be accessed in Video Cloud Studio by opening the Campaign module and then by selecting <strong>Export Campign Data</strong> in the left navigation.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/analytics/campaign-nav.png" /></figure>
    <p>Choose to export the data in CSV or Excel format. You will then be able to generate interaction reports by analyzing the data locally in a spreadsheet.</p>
    <h3>What reports can I create with the data?</h3>
    <p>You will be able to create reports that calculate what percentage of play session performed the desired action: clicking a link, navigating within the video, or submitting a response to an in-video question. The three core interaction reports are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click Through Rate</li>
      <li>Navigation Rate</li>
      <li>Response Rate</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interaction rate formulae</h3>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td width="240">Click Through Rate</td>
          <td width="330">Link / Play * 100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Navigation Rate</td>
          <td>Navigation / Play * 100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Response Rate</td>
          <td>Answer / Play * 100</td>

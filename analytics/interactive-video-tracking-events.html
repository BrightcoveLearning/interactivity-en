    <p>At HapYak, we track how your viewers are interacting with your video in detail. More than just play and pause, we track a whole set of specific events associated with your video that give you deep-level insights into viewer choices, behavior and engagement. </p>
    <p>There are three event<sup>1</sup> types:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Player Action</strong> details how a viewer played, paused, and progressed through the video.</li>
      <li><strong>Annotation View</strong> and <strong>Annotation Ended</strong> details which annotations were seen by the viewer and for how long.</li>
      <li><strong>Annotation Action</strong> details how the user interacted with the annotation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each event has a set of properties associated with it. For example, the event of a click on an annotation call-to-action could have the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The viewer’s <strong>UserID</strong><sup>2</sup> was “kyle_morton”</li>
      <li>The annotation’s <strong>duration</strong> was 8.35 seconds</li>
      <li>5 seconds <strong>elapsed</strong> before the viewer clicked the link</li>
      <li>The annotation’s link <strong>target</strong> was <code>http://www.rei.com/product/763713</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>---------------</p>
    <p><sup>1</sup> Attribute name is &quot;event&quot;</p>
    <p><sup>2</sup> Available when the viewer user is logged into the Portal</p>

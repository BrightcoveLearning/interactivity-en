    <p>HapYak has a Google Analytics add-on that will send interaction and engagement events directly from HapYak into Google Analytics. Details on the module are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QobjonB3CWFR8Lf8EG42WenWAPQlbqj0ZfZgtDRJn3g/edit" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
    <p>This is a great way to send this rich new stream of viewer intelligence into a system you already use to track the effectiveness of your marketing and digital initiatives.</p>

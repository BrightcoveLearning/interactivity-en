    <p>HapYak annotations are delivered using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. This means they work out of the box on the vast majority of operating systems and browsers.<br><br>Specifically, we certify the following browsers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>The latest two major versions of all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE / Edge, Safari)</b> For latest versions, click <a href="http://outdatedbrowser.com/en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Safari on iPad</b></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, HapYak videos will work just fine on most other browsers. If your video is playing without the interactions, check the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Most often it's because, the browser doesn't support HTML5. (For example IE8). You can see if your browser supports HTML5 <a href="http://html5test.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. To update your browser, click <a href="http://outdatedbrowser.com/en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mobile Phones: By default, when you click play on a video on many phones, it actually plays the video in the native video player app (QuickTime player on iPhones for example) rather than on the web page. &nbsp;This strips away any overlays, including HapYak's. There's an easy fix for that. Click <a href="/mobile/mobile-iphone-ipad-android-support.html" data-is-internal-link="true">here</a> for more info.</p>

    </ol>

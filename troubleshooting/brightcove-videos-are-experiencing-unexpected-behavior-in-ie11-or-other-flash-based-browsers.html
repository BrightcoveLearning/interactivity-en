    <p class="no-margin">Brightcove has upgraded their Flash browser compatibility to support <a href="http://www.flashls.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flashls</a> on Brightcove Player versions 6.12.2 or later, a player plugin to enhance Flash Playback support for HLS videos. This new capability has significant architectural differences from the previous VideoJS Flash Technology on earlier player versions, and as a result has been known to interfere with interactive video playback in different environments, specifically Brightcove Gallery.</p>
    <p class="no-margin"></p>
    <p class="no-margin">The recommended solution from Brightcove is to revert the player back to a version of 6.12.1 or earlier (version 5.28.1 would work well for most Brightcove Customers). &nbsp;</p>

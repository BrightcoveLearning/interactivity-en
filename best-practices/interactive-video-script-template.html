    <p>This topic contains a sample interactive video script. Many of you will be familiar with the two column audio / video format. This script adds a third column, &quot;annotations&quot;. At HapYak, we typically fill this column first and let the annotations inform the audio and video columns. This was an actual shooting script for <a href="http://go.hapyak.com/8-most-common-interactive-video-annotations/">this marketing video</a> we produced. </p>

    <h2 id="sample">Sample interactive video script</h2>
    <p><strong>Title</strong>: Most Common Interactive Annotations</p>
    <p> <strong>Audience</strong>: Consideration phase leads</p>
    <p> <strong>Goal</strong>: Viewing of 3+ segments to indicate a MQL</p>
    <p> <strong>Key Interaction</strong>: Sign Up / Login</p>
    <p>This is a branching video with a splash screen like this <a href="http://brightcove.hapyak.com/detail/videos/emarketing/video/4264491577001/lenovo---on-page-communication?autoStart=true">Lenovo example </a>- use Chris' icons for each of the types of the annotations. Make the icons 3D with a subtle drop shadow.</p>
    <p>Each section of the branching video is itself a micro-learning video -  90 seconds or less. It will clearly and simply say for each annotation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is</li>
      <li>Why you’d use it</li>
      <li>What value it has </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Embed</strong>:</p>
    <p>The Master Branching video will be 960 x 540 on a Landing Page directed at consideration phase leads. </p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: This is a sample interactive video script. Many of you will be familiar with the two column audio / video format.

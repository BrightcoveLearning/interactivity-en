    <p>This topic contains a sample interactive video script. Many of you will be familiar with the two column audio / video format. This script adds a third column, &quot;annotations&quot;. At HapYak, we typically fill this column first and let the annotations inform the audio and video columns.</p>

    <h2 id="sample">Sample interactive video script</h2>
    <p><strong>Title</strong>: Most Common Interactive Annotations</p>
    <p> <strong>Audience</strong>: Consideration phase leads</p>
    <p> <strong>Goal</strong>: Viewing of 3+ segments to indicate a MQL</p>
    <p> <strong>Key Interaction</strong>: Sign Up / Login</p>
    <p>This is a branching video with a splash screen like this <a href="http://brightcove.hapyak.com/detail/videos/emarketing/video/4264491577001/lenovo---on-page-communication?autoStart=true">Lenovo example </a>- use Chris' icons for each of the types of the annotations. Make the icons 3D with a subtle drop shadow.</p>
    <p>Each section of the branching video is itself a micro-learning video -  90 seconds or less. It will clearly and simply say for each annotation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What it is</li>
      <li>Why you’d use it</li>
      <li>What value it has </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Embed</strong>:</p>
    <p>The Master Branching video will be 960 x 540 on a Landing Page directed at consideration phase leads. </p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: This is a sample interactive video script. Many of you will be familiar with the two column audio / video format. This script adds a third column, “interactions”. At HapYak, we typically fill this column first and let the interactions inform the audio and video columns. This was an actual shooting script for this marketing video we produced.</aside>

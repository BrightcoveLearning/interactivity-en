        <p>Yes! HapYak annotations are fully responsive for any size screen and work on all mobile devices. Note of course that mobile phones in particular are a small form factor so you'll want to ensure that annotations are authored with that in mind.</p>
        
        <h3 id="ipad" data-post-processed="true">iPad</h3>
        <p>iPad is supported out-of-the-box.</p>

        <p>Apple supports interactive video for iOS 10 and higher.</p>
        
        <p>You'll want to ensue that the embed code from your video player (Brightcove, YouTube, Wistia, Kaltura, Video.js etc...) will include the <b><i>"playsinline"</i> tag</b> to interactive playback.</p>
        
        <p>With some players you can simply check a box in your account settings, while with others you may need to add the tag to your embed code by typing it in. Here are the details...</p>

        <p><b>Android</b></p>
        
        <p>Android has a large constellation of device / os versions / carrier combinations so like most apps and SaaS apps it is not officially supported. But the good news is the vast majority of these environments simply works out of the box as most support inline playback of video.<br></p>

        <h3 id="inline-v-full-screen" data-post-processed="true">Inline v. Full Screen</h3>
        <p><b>Inline</b> means the interactive video will play back in the exact place on the web page it is embedded. <b>Full Screen</b> means that when a viewer taps play, the interactive video will take over the screen during play back.</p>

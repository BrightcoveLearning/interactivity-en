    <h2 id="load-external-url">Load external URL:</h2>
    <p>Just like you would add a link in a web page, now you can add it in a video. You can load a web page, pdf, document, another video, email program, etc.... <br>
      Example: Load a web page - <a href="http://corp.hapyak.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://corp.hapyak.com/</a> <br>
      Example: Load a new Email draft - <a href="mailto:support@hapyak.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mailto:support@hapyak.com</a> <br>
      Example: Load a PDF file - <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5xLrWha_BgPZGs4UEstcUpuWUk" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5xLrWha_BgPZGs4UEstcUpuWUk</a> </p>
    <h3 id="ensuring-external-urls-open-in-the-same-windowtab">Ensuring external URLs open in the same window/tab</h3>
    <p>You can set <i>all links</i> clicked on your videos to open in the same window/tab rather than a new one. This is analogous to setting target="_self" or "open in same window" in a CMS for example. </p>
    <p>The limitations are: <br>
      A) The target domain must be on the same domain that the video is hosted on. <br>
      B) <i>Every</i> link on every project will load in the same window. <br>
      C) Must be using Native Player embed code (not the HapYak player which is an iframe embed code). </p>
    <p>If you would like this set simply email <a href="mailto:support@hapyak.com?subject=Please%20Provision%20%22localLinks%22%20for%20my%20HapYak%20group&amp;amp;body=Please%20Provision%20%22localLinks%22%20for%20my%20HapYak%20group" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">support@hapyak.com</a> and ask for <b>localLinks</b> to be provisioned on your group. </p>

    <h2 id="jump-to-annotation--jump-to-time">Jump to Annotation / Jump to Time:</h2>
    <p>Click "Jump to video time" and select another annotation you would like to link to from the dropdown list...</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/annotations/jump-to-annotation.png"></figure>
    <p>or enter a specific time in the video to link to...</p>

    <h2 id="pro-tip-jump-to-chapters">Pro Tip: Jump to Chapters</h2>
    <p>Because you can link to a specific annotation, <b>adding chapter markers to every video is a great idea</b>. Without also adding a Chapter Menu, they are invisible to the viewer and allow you to quickly select times in the video to jump to via this Link to Annotation feature.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Also, if you change the start time of the chapter annotation that you are linked to (because say a new version of the video has been uploaded as the <a href="/customize/changing-the-video-source-of-a-project.html" data-is-internal-link="true">video source</a>), it will automatically adjust. </p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="action-to-take-if-the-viewer-doesnt-click">Action to take if the viewer doesn't click:</h2>
    <p>The video can continue playing if the viewer doesn't click, or can be looped to the beginning of the annotation to ensure they click.</p>

    <p>Automatically loading a URL without a user-initiated action is generally discouraged UX - and technically prohibited by browsers in many cases.</p>
    <p>HapYak annotations don't have the capability to load a URL without a user action. However, If you're technically inclined, you can do this yourself with our <a href="/references/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">API</a>. You would create a javascript listener for the video-complete event, then perform the desired action. If you decide to take that approach HapYak can provide some code examples to help.</p>
    <p>Here's a working example:</p>
    <br>
    <a href="http://jsbin.com/wilaq/1/edit" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://jsbin.com/wilaq/1/edit</a>
    <p>At the end of the video it auto navigates to hapyak.com.  Here are the important lines of code:</p>
    <br>
    <code>onTrackingEvent: function(data) {</code> <br>
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp;if (data.event==="Player Action" &amp;&amp; data.properties.Action.indexOf("End")===0) {</code> <br>
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; window.location.href = "http://corp.hapyak.com"}} &nbsp;</code> <br>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: This even works on an iPhone (even when the video is playing in the native QuickTime app).</aside>

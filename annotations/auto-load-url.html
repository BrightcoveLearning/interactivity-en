    <p class="intercom-align-left">Automatically loading a URL without a user-initiated action is generally discouraged UX - and technically prohibited by browsers in many cases.
      <br>
      <br>HapYak annotations don't have the capability to load a URL without a user action. However, If you're technically inclined, you can do this yourself with our
      <a href="/references/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">API</a>. You would create a javascript listener for the video-complete event, then perform the desired action.
      <br>
      <br>If you decide to take that approach HapYak can provide some code examples to help.
      <br>
      <br>ï»¿Here's a working example:
      <br>
      <a href="http://jsbin.com/wilaq/1/edit" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://jsbin.com/wilaq/1/edit</a>
      <br>At the end of the video it auto navigates to hapyak.com
      <br>
      <br>Here are the important lines of code:
      <br>
      <br>
      <code>onTrackingEvent: function(data) {</code>
      <br>
      <code>&nbsp; &nbsp;if (data.event==="Player Action" &amp;&amp; data.properties.Action.indexOf("End")===0) {</code>
      <br>
      <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; window.location.href = "http://corp.hapyak.com"}} &nbsp;</code>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Note: this even works on an iPhone (even when the video is playing in the native QuickTime app).</i>

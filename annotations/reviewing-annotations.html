    <p>The annotation list displays a list of all the annotations on a project, template or experience. It also provides an easy way to edit, copy or delete annotations. The annotation list appears below the preview video when you edit a project, template or experience.</p>

    <h2 id="using-the-annotation-list">Using the Annotation List</h2>
    <p>The annotation list is the best way to quickly scan all of the annotations and select which ones you need to take action on. There's no need to play the video to reach the annotation. You'll see at a glance an icon for the annotation type, the text of the annotation and start and end times.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/annotations/annotation-list.png"> </figure>
    <p>You can see also quickly see which annotations have <a href="/annotations/annotation-options.html">annotation options</a> set like pause, gate or display rule. The <strong>More</strong> icon primarily indicates that a <a href="/annotations/link-options.html" data-is-internal-link="true">link</a> is set. </p>
    <p>The <strong>Actions</strong> column lets you Edit, Copy or Delete the annotation. </p>

    <h2 id="copy-annotation">Copying annotations</h2>
    <p>Copying an annotation is useful when you want to create an annotation that is similar to an existing annotation. Copy it and then edit the new annotation as needed.</p>

    <h2 id="search-for-text-in-annotations">Search for Text in Annotations</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you'll have many annotations on a HapYak project and you'll want to be able to quickly find a particular one (for example, any that use the words "Click Here" or have the text "Review Quiz".)</p>
    <p>You can quickly do so in the Annotation List by simply by selecting Find on your browser (âŒ˜F) and then searching for the term or word(s).</p>

    <p>The Annotation List lets you quickly see and navigate to all the annotations on your video and then edit, copy or delete with one click.</p>

    <h2 id="using-the-annotation-list">Using the Annotation List</h2>
    <p>The Annotation List is the best way to quickly scan all your annotations and select which ones you want to take action. So there's no need to play the video to reach the annotation. You'll see at a glance an icon for the annotation type, the text of the annotation and start and end times.</p>
    <div class="intercom-container intercom-align-center">

    </div>
    <p>You can see also quickly see which annotations have
      <a href="/annotations/annotation-options.html" data-is-internal-link="true">annotation options</a> set like Pause, Gate or Display Rule. The "More" icon primarily indicates that a
      <a href="/annotations/link-options.html" data-is-internal-link="true">link</a> is set.
    </p>
    <p>The
      <strong>Actions</strong> column lets you Edit, Copy or Delete the annotation.

    <h2 id="copy-annotation">Copy Annotation</h2>
    <p>This is a powerful functionality that lets you save time by copying any existing annotation and then modifying the copy. Keeping you from having to create each annotation from scratch.

    <h2 id="search-for-text-in-annotations">Search for Text in Annotations</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you'll have many annotations on a HapYak project and you'll want to be able to quickly find a particular one (for example, any that use the words "Click Here" or have the text "Review Quiz".)</p>
    <p>You can quickly do so in the Annotation List by simply by selecting Find on your browser (âŒ˜F) and then searching for the term or word(s).</p>

    <p>Additionally, HapYak works with videos that already have closed captions included on them. Simply ensure that the embed code or URL you use for your
      <strong>video source</strong>ï»¿ includes a reference to the closed captions.
      <br>
      <br>If needed, you can change the video source of any HapYak project by clicking the "
      <strong>Settings</strong>" button and clicking "
      <strong>Video Source</strong>".

    <p>In your editor, you have access to some CSS classes that are built in to the HapYak Platform. The intention of these classes is to help solve issues commonly faced while authoring content. This Article will cover how to apply classes, followed by a breakdown of each class, what it does, and which annotations it is compatible with.</p>
    <p>In addition to the classes described below, there are a number of others available to you that add simple animated transitions to your annotations. To read an article about the animation CSS classes, <a href="/annotations/custom-transitions-with-animate-css-beta.html" data-is-internal-link="true">click here</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="apply-class">How to Apply Classes</h2>

    <p>Add class names to the field exactly as they appear in the list below. Multiple classes can be applied to a single annotation, but must be separated by a space, and should not be preceded by a period.</p>

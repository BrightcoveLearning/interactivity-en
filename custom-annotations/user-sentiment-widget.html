      The User Sentiment widget is a great way to gather customer feedback about the helpfulness of your video projects. Users can customize their feedback using three different icon types: Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down, Star Rating (out of 5), and Emoticons.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>When using the “Thumbs Up/Down” icon type, users can turn on a count for the number of likes and dislikes. The two counts can be activated separately from the configure modal.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>A threshold can be set for each count, which will prevent the count from displaying until a certain number of likes/dislikes have been recorded.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you’re not ready to show like or dislike counts yet, no sweat. While using the “Thumbs Up/Down” icon type we will still continue to collect the number of likes and dislikes which you can choose to display at a later date.</p>

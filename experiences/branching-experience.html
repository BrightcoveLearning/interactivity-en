    <p>The <b>Branching Experience</b> allows you to quickly string together multiple videos and add annotations that let the viewer and jump from video to video. This creates a "choose-your-own-adventure" experience for your viewers.</p>
    <p>HapYak's Branching Experience editor dramatically streamlines the editing process, cutting work-time from hours to minutes and is available out-of-the-box to all plans.</p>
    <!-- <p>Best of all, it works with <a href="http://kb.hapyak.com/specific-players/what-video-players-hapyak-supports" data-is-internal-link="true">all supported video players</a> - Brightcove, Wistia, Vimeo, JW Player, YouTube, Kaltura, Video.js, Ooyala, etc... and of course videos directly uploaded to HapYak.</p> -->

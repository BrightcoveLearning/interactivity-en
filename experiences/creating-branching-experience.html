    <p>The <b>Branching Experience</b> allows you to quickly string together multiple videos and add annotations that let the viewer  jump from video to video. This creates a "choose your own adventure" type experience for your viewers.</p>
    <p>The Branching Experience editor dramatically streamlines the editing process, cutting work time from hours to minutes and is available out-of-the-box to all plans.</p>
<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you have used the Brightcove Playlists method to author branching experiences in the past, that is now replaced by this simplified, more streamlined authoring method.</aside>

      <li>If you select "Jump to Video" you can then select "<b>Jump to video time</b>" to go to specific point in the destination video.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>If you just select Jump to video time <i>without</i> a Jump to Video selected it will simply jump to that time in the current video. </li>
      <li>At the bottom you'll see the full list of videos. Simply drag and drop to re-arrange the order of videos or click Edit to edit a different video. </li>

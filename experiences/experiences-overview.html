    <p>A HapYak <b>Experience</b> is a video with other elements (like synced slides or an e-commerce cart) outside the video player that dynamically interact with video player.</p>
    <p>HapYak experiences allow you to dynamically communicate between the video and the web page itself, opening the door to a new generation of lean-forward interactive realities for your viewers.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="video-landing-page">Video Landing Page</h3>
    <p>A <b>Video Landing Page</b> experience is a great way to create a playlist of videos, set up a dedicated landing page link, and quickly add branding to the header and footers to the landing page.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Furthermore, there are two options for <b>Video Landing Pages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Single Video Landing Pages</b> hide the other videos from the user's view, forcing the user to navigate only via the Branching/CYOA annotations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Playlist Landing Pages</b> show all videos included in the experience at the bottom of the screen, allowing users to quickly jump from video to video at will.&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="slidesync">SlideSync</h3>
    <p>HapYak <b>SlideSync</b> is a powerful interactive video experience allowing users to present related slide decks or presentation imagery while the video plays.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Experiences use HapYak Player with native controls as the embed type. This is so multi-video experiences have a standard look and feel</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Viewer Interaction on the standard HapYak annotations is included in <a href="http://www.hapyak.com/portal/reports" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HapYak Reports</a> as normal.</p>
      </li>

    <p>Before authoring any annotations do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that you have a <a href="/getting-started/configuring-player-plugin.html">HapYak-enabled Brightcove Player</a></li>
      <li>Ensure that a project has been <a href="/getting-started/getting-started-interactivity.html" data-is-internal-link="true">auto-created</a> in HapYak for each Brightcove video you'd like to use in the branching experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have done that you simply use the <a href="/experiences/creating-branching-experience.html" data-is-internal-link="true">Branching Experience</a> editor to author.</p>
    <p>If you have used the Brightcove Playlists method to author branching experiences in the past, that is now replaced by this simplified, more streamlined authoring method.</p>

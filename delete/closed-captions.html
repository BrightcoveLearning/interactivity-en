    <p>Additionally, HapYak works with videos that already have closed captions included on them. Simply ensure that the embed code or URL you use for your <strong>video source</strong>ï»¿ includes a reference to the closed captions.</p>
    <p>If needed, you can change the video source of any HapYak project by clicking the " <strong>Settings</strong>" button and clicking " <strong>Video Source</strong>". </p>

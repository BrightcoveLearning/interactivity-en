    <p>Recently we got a question. "On the quizzes, can it be set so that if the learner fails a quiz they cannot move forward in a video?"</p>
    <p>Yes - that is supported out of the box.</p>
    <p>When you are configuring a Quiz,&nbsp;</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click " <b>Edit</b>" on the annotation </li>
      <li>Set " <b>Gate:Y</b>" </li>
      <li>Under Options / Review Screen, <b>uncheck "Allow viewer to see correct answer(s)"</b> </li>
      <li>Under Options / Pass/Fail Actions, click " <b>On Fail</b>" &nbsp;and then set " <b>Jump to Video Time"</b>to <b>0 seconds,</b> and finally, check <b> "Reset questions"</b> </li>
    </ol>
    <p>A viewer will not be able to proceed in the video until they have correctly answered the question.&nbsp;</p>

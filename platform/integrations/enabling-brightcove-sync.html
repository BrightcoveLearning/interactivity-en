    <p>By default, projects that are auto-created using a HapYak-enabled Brightcove Player will have the same title as the Brightcove video title when the project was auto-created and will have no thumbnail image. The Brightcove Sync feature can be used to ensure that the Brightcove Interactivity project title is updated to match either the title  of the video in Brightcove.</p>
    <p>Syncing your Brightcove and Brightcove Interactivity accounts will add thumbnail images to any Brightcove videos present in your Brightcove Interactivity account that don't already have them. Using the Brightcove Sync feature is a huge time saver, especially when creating playlists in Brightcove Interactivity Experiences.</p>

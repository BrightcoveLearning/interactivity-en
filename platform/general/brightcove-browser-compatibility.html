      If you experience an issue with interactivity on one of the systems listed above please contact us immediately with your operating system, browser version, and the page which you are viewing so that we can investigate the issue.</p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use of Widgets, AddOns or Custom CSS may impact browser compatibility. You will need to verify those extensions independently in consultation with your Account Manager. </li>
      <li>We will be actively testing and improving the HapYak software to support new browser versions during the first months after a browser release. &nbsp;Please contact our team with any questions or concerns which may arise when using new browser versions. </li>

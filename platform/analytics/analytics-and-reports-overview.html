    <h2 id="heartbeat">Heartbeat</h2>
    <p>This Heartbeat Report tells you who has been watching your on demand videos over the last few minutes.    The Heartbeat report displays real-time data from the last 7 days (updating every 10 seconds). All of the data in the report can be found in the User Activity Stream report for on-demand downloading.</p>
    <p>The report includes the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Action</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/platform/analytics/icon-play.png" /> - Play - The viewer played the video</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Interaction rate</strong> - Plays with interaction / plays. Track this closely. You want to get to as close to 100% as possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Plays</strong> - The total number of video plays. A play is counted if a viewer clicks play or if the videos auto plays. If a viewer re-watches a video in a given session, that counts as one play.</li>
      <li><strong>Plays with interaction</strong> - The total number of plays where a viewer clicked at least one interaction.</li>
      <li><strong>People</strong> - The total number of individual viewers who watched a video, aka users.</li>

    <p>Here's a great trick to pass in known viewer information from an email campaign in Mailchimp. When you add a link to the interactive video in Mailchimp, add query parameters to the end that reference the Mailchimp merge tags. That will automatically identify who is watching the video to Brightcove Interactivity analytics.</p>
    <p>Here's an example:</p>

    <p>The Google Analytics Integration Module captures core user interactions and records them as Behavioral Events in Google Analytics. The recorded interaction data will enable you to generate reports in Google Analytics for Click Through Rate, Navigation Rate, and Response Rate. This is a great way to send this rich new stream of viewer intelligence into a system you already use to track the effectiveness of your marketing and digital initiatives.</p>

    <h2 id="data-collected">What data is collected?</h2>
    <p>Brightcove Interactivity passes the following interactions to Google Analytics for tracking:</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td>Play</td>
          <td>Recorded once when the video first plays</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Link</td>
          <td>Recorded every time a link in the video is clicked</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Navigation</td>
          <td>Recorded every time a Chapter, or Jump-to-time link in the video is clicked</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Quiz</td>
          <td>Recorded every time a quiz answer is submitted</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
    <p>Google Event Tracking allows tracking of four attributes for an event, shown in the table below.</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <thead class="bcls-table__head">
        <tr>
          <th>Attribute</th>
          <th>What Brightcove Interactivity Send</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td>Category</td>
          <td>Project Title and ID e.g. "My Interactive Video Intro (001234)"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Action</td>
          <td>Play | Link | Navigation | Quiz <br/>
            <br/>
            Link-Info | Navigation-Info | Quiz-Info </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Label</td>
          <td>For Action=Link-Info the Label will be set to the URL of the link <br/>
            <br/>
            For Action=Navigation-Info the Label will be set to the title of the Chapter <br/>
            <br/>
            For Action=Quiz-Info the Label will be set to the Question text and include a Correct or Incorrect indicator. For example, "What is 2+4 (Correct)"</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Value</td>
          <td>Not used</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2 id="create">How to create reports</h2>
    <h3>Where does the data show up in Google Analytics?</h3>
    <p>Events can be accessed inside of the Google Analytics tools from the left-side menu BEHAVIOR  &gt; EVENTS.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/platform/analytics/ga-left-nav.png"></figure>
    <h3>What reports can I create with the data?</h3>
    <p>You will be able to create reports that calculate what percentage of play session performed the desired action: clicking a link, navigating within the video, or submitting a response to an in-video form. </p>
    <p>The three core interaction reports are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Click Through Rate</li>
      <li>Navigation Rate</li>
      <li>Response Rate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To calculate interaction rates session-based numbers must be used. In Google Analytics these will be labeled as <em>Unique Events</em>. Google defines <strong>Unique Events</strong> as "<em>A count of the number of times an event with the category/action/label value was seen at least once within a session.</em>" </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/platform/analytics/ga-header.png"></figure>
    <h3>Step by step instructions</h3>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>In Google Analytics, access go to the Behavior &gt; Events &gt; Top Events screen</li>
      <li>Ensure "Event Category" is selected as the Primary Dimension for the data table
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/platform/analytics/ga-sbs-primary-dimension.png"></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Use the data table search box and enter the name of the Brightcove Interactivity Project Name</li>
      <li>Click the row in the data table matching the Project Name
        <ul>
          <li>A new data table will load showing the actions for the given video</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Find the row with the Action "Play" and note the number in the Unique Events column (UE-Play).
        <ul>
          <li>This is the denominator for rate calculations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Find the row with the Action corresponding to the metric you wish to measure (Link, Navigation,Quiz) and note the number in the Unique Events column (UE-Link, UE-Navigation, UE-Quiz).
        <ul>
          <li>This is the numerator for rate calculations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perform the proper calculation for the report you wish to generate.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Interaction rate formulae</h3>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td>Click Through Rate</td>
          <td>UE-Link / UE-Play		* 100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Navigation Rate</td>
          <td>UE-Navigation / UE-Play	* 100</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Response Rate</td>
          <td>UE-Quiz / UE-Play		* 100</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="detailed-data">What detailed data is available?</h2>
    <p>In addition to the interactions, additional details about exactly what was clicked is included as part of the "-Info" events.</p>
    <h3>Link / URLs</h3>
    <p>Events with the Action Link-Info will also have Label set to the clicked URL</p>
    <h3>Navigation / Chapters</h3>
    <p>Events with the Action Navigation-Info will also have Label set to the clicked Chapter</p>
    <h3>Response / Questions</h3>
    <p>Events with the Action Quiz-Info will also have Label set to the answered Question as well as an indicator for whether or not the answer was Correct or Incorrect.</p>
    <p>For example, "What is 2+4 (Correct)"</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/platform/analytics/ga-example.png"></figure>
    <h3>User tracking</h3>
    <p>If you utilize Brightcove Interactivity user-level tracking that information will carry through to Google Analytics as "Custom Variables" associated with the recorded Events.</p>
    <p>Brightcove Interactivity records the "User ID" in custom variable slot 4 and "Username" in slot 5, if those values are present.</p>
    <p>This information can be included in reports and data exports from Google Analytics. For more information please consult the <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingCustomVariables">Google documentation</a>.</p>

    <p>Brightcove Interactivity reports and analytics are a powerful tool to understand how individual and groups of viewers are interacting with and experiencing your video. We track every individual viewer as they watch the video and you can identify exactly who these viewers are, for example, by username or email address (where email address is passed in as userId). Here's how to do it. </p>
    <h3 id="1-pass-in-a-userid-username-or-email-address">1. Pass in a userID, username or email address</h3>
    <p>You can do so via the Brightcove Interactivity Embed API or by appending the parameter to the URL where the video is embedded. The parameters are viewable on our <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/interactivity/embed-api/reference.html">Docs</a>. </p>
    <h3 id="2-add-a-sign-in-annotation-aka-lead-wall-turnstile-gate">2. Add a Sign In Annotation (aka "Lead Wall", "Turnstile", "Gate")</h3>

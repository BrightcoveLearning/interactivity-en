    <p>Facebook and Twitter do not support third-party interactive video technology. A best practice for sharing a Brightcove Interactivity project on Facebook or Twitter is to share a link to the web page where the video is embedded or to the Brightcove Interactivity landing page. This has the added benefit of directing traffic to your web properties. We recommend adding a poster image of the video to increase the click-through rate to the page.</p>

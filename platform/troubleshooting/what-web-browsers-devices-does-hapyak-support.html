    <p>Annotations are delivered using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. This means they work out of the box on the vast majority of operating systems and browsers. Specifically, we certify the following browsers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The latest two major versions of all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari). For latest versions, click <a href="http://outdatedbrowser.com/en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Safari on iPad</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, Brightcove Interactivity videos will work just fine on most other browsers. If your video is playing without the interactions, check the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Most often it's because the browser doesn't support HTML5. (For example, IE8). You can see if your browser supports HTML5 <a href="http://html5test.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. To update your browser, click <a href="http://outdatedbrowser.com/en" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Mobile phones: By default, on many phones, when you click play, it actually plays the video in the native video player app (QuickTime player on iOS devices for example) rather than on the web page. &nbsp;This strips away any overlays. There's an easy fix for that, see <a href="/general/mobile-iphone-ipad-android-support.html" data-is-internal-link="true">this topic</a> for more info.</li>

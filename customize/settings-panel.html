    <p class="no-margin">When editing a HapYak project, click <b>Settings</b> for the following options:</p>
    
    <h3 id="video-source" data-post-processed="true">Video source</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">You can change the video that is behind the annotations. &nbsp;This is used when you have a new version of the video that you'd like to use. &nbsp;It is also used when you'd like to create a project that is similar to one you've already created. &nbsp;You can copy the original, then simply replace the video source of the copy.</p>
    
    <h3 id="tags" data-post-processed="true">Tags</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">Tags are used for organizing projects into groups. You can more easily search your projects and more easily filter in reports based on tags.</p>
    
    <p class="no-margin">Tags are also used in some direct integrations with other systems to automatically add annotations to videos like with Brightcove Plugin)</p>
    
    <p class="no-margin">Tags should be <i>all lower case, no spaces. </i>(ex/ csat-question). Separate multiple tags with a comma (ex/ csat-question, onboarding). Make sure to click "Save" and then "Submit" to save the tags.</p>
    
    <div class="intercom-container"><img src="/assets/images/customize/tags-sample.png"></div>
    <h3 id="track-id" data-post-processed="true">Track ID</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">The track is the set of annotations on a video. &nbsp;This field is for reference.</p>
    
    <!-- <h3 id="templates-applied" data-post-processed="true">Templates Applied</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">This is where you apply <a href="http://kb.hapyak.com/knowledgebase/articles/340210-templates" data-is-internal-link="true">templates</a> to the project.</p> -->
    
    <h3 id="show-questions" data-post-processed="true">Show questions</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">Choose to show <a href="/annotations/quiz-annotation.html" data-is-internal-link="true">quiz questions</a> to the viewer only once on the first view, or every view (including repeated viewings).</p>
    
    <h3 id="custom-annotation-css-url-available-with-enterprise-license" data-post-processed="true">Custom Annotation CSS URL (Available with Enterprise License)</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">Many customers apply a custom CSS to their project - for example to change the colors, fonts or other style of their annotations. &nbsp;You host the CSS file (just as you would for your web pages) and then paste in the URL for that CSS here. HapYak wants your interactive videos to be beautiful and reflect your branding and style. For all Pro customers and up we provide an initial CSS file based on your guidelines. Contact <a href="mailto:success@hapyak.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">success@hapyak.com</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="custom-control-css-url-available-with-enterprise-license" data-post-processed="true">Custom Control CSS URL (Available with Enterprise License)</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">This is rarely used. &nbsp;When it is, it is to completely redesign the style of the HapYak player. For small changes and tweaks to the HapYak player (like removing the annotation markers), we recommend using the Custom Annotation CSS field.</p>
    
    <h3 id="string-resource-url" data-post-processed="true">String Resource URL</h3>
    <p class="no-margin">Used for localizing the buttons and prompts of the video.</p>
    
    <p class="no-margin"><b>Control Bar Style</b></p>
    
    <p class="no-margin">Allows users to Hide or show Skip Buttons, Logo, Timeline, or Annotation Markers.</p>
    
    <p class="no-margin"><b>Thumbnail</b></p>
    
    <p class="no-margin">Allows users to upload a thumbnail image for the project</p>
    
    <p class="no-margin"><b>Convert Project To Template</b></p>
    
    <p class="no-margin">Allows users to convert any project into a template<br><i>Note: This option will permanently remove the selected project from the projects folder and turn it into a template. This action <b>CANNOT BE UNDONE</b>. Take note of which projects you convert or make sure to make copies of projects before you convert them.&nbsp;</i></p>

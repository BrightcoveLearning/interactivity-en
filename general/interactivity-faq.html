      <dt class="bcls-question">How do I upload videos?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer">Typically, videos are not directly uploaded to HapYak. Rather, videos remain where they always have been (an existing video host, locally hosted on a server, etc...). Users copy the link or embed code of the video and paste it into the " <strong>URL Or Embed Code</strong>" tab in the " <strong>New Project</strong>" menu on HapYak and then add annotations. If you don't have a video provider, we'd be happy to recommend one.
    <p>Alternatively, users can upload an .mp4 file directly to HapYak by choosing the " <strong>Upload</strong>" tab in the " <strong>New Project</strong>" menu and selecting the file on their system. </p></dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question">I don't have a video host. I only have a video file (.mp4, .mov, etc...) Can I still use HapYak?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer">Absolutely! Simply ensure your video lives on a server that will give you a link to the URL of the file (like Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc...). Copy the link to the file, paste into a new project in HapYak. Select any open source video player from the "embed type" list, for example videoJS.</dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question">I upload my videos directly into my LMS or CMS and don't know the video file URL. How can I access it?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer">When most LMSs and CMSs allow you to upload a file, they place it on a server so other users can see it. However, each one does it differently, so finding the URL might be a challenge. Please, send us an email Brightcove Support directly and we'll help you locate where the file URL is located. </dd>

      <dt class="bcls-question">How do I upload videos?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer"><p>Typically, videos are not directly uploaded to HapYak. Rather, videos remain where they always have been (an existing video host, locally hosted on a server, etc...). Users copy the link or embed code of the video and paste it into the " <strong>URL Or Embed Code</strong>" tab in the " <strong>New Project</strong>" menu on HapYak and then add annotations. If you don't have a video provider, we'd be happy to recommend one.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, users can upload an .mp4 file directly to HapYak by choosing the " <strong>Upload</strong>" tab in the " <strong>New Project</strong>" menu and selecting the file on their system. </p></dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question">I don't have a video host. I only have a video file (.mp4, .mov, etc...) Can I still use HapYak?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer"><p>Absolutely! Simply ensure your video lives on a server that will give you a link to the URL of the file (like Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc...). Copy the link to the file, paste into a new project in HapYak. Select any open source video player from the "embed type" list, for example videoJS.</p></dd>
      <dt class="bcls-question">I upload my videos directly into my LMS or CMS and don't know the video file URL. How can I access it?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer"><p>When most LMSs and CMSs allow you to upload a file, they place it on a server so other users can see it. However, each one does it differently, so finding the URL might be a challenge. Please, send us an email Brightcove Support directly and we'll help you locate where the file URL is located.</p></dd>
        <dt class="bcls-question">Can I integrate Brightcove Interactivity with an LMS?</dt>
      <dd class="bcls-answer">
        <p>Brightcove Interactivity integrates easily with your LMS. You can pass in User ID and related information to track individual users as they interact with videos and personalize the viewing experience for them. You can also send our robust reporting and analytics data to your LMS.</p>
    <p>There are a number of other custom functionalities that are enabled through an LMS integration. In addition, you can always use our <a href="/references/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APIs</a> to connect your LMS or other external systems. For more information, see <a href="/integrations/integrating-with-an-lms.html">Integrating with an LMS</a>.</p></dd>

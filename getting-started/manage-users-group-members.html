    <p>You can invite colleagues and collaborators to your HapYak group. These users are called <b>Group Members</b> as they will have access to all the same projects and reports that you do in your Group. </p>
    <p>There are three roles for Group Members:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Admin</b> - Access to all functionality, including configuring styles and add-ons for projects, viewing reports, creating sub-groups, and inviting new users.</li>
      <li><b>Editor</b> - Can create, edit, and share projects. Can view reports.</li>
      <li><b>Reporter</b> - Can only view reports.</li>
    </ul>

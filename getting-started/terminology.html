    <h2 id="what-is-interactive-video" class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">What is Interactive Video?</h2>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">Interactive video is video that works like the web. You can click it, you can jump to what you want, and it reacts to your actions, making it more engaging. One of the things that businesses like most about interactive video is that it can be measured, so they have concrete evidence about what's effective and can make informed decisions to make it even better.</p>
    <h2 id="what-are-annotations" class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">What are Annotations?</h2>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">Anything you add to a video using HapYak; an overlay, a link, or a quiz are all annotations. An annotation enhances the video and is synchronized to it, so it looks like part of the video and shows up while you're watching.</p>
    <h2 id="what-are-tracks" class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">What are Tracks?</h2>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">The term "track" refers to a collection of annotations on a single video.
      <br>Most people only ever have one track for a video, but in some cases, like branching or personalization, it is possible to have more than one.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-templates" class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">What are Templates?</h2>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">A "template" is a re-usable track that contains annotations you want to show up on dozens or hundreds of videos.
      <br>Typically a template is used for common interactions, like a call-to-action that isn't specific to one video.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-project" class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">What is a Project?</h2>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">A HapYak project contains one video, the tracks for that video, and any unique configuration - like custom styles or languages settings.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-an-api" class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">What is an API?</h2>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">An API is an Application Programming Interface. It's how different software talks to each other.
      <br>HapYak has a full set of APIs that people use to extend capabilities and to integrate HapYak into their own platforms.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-do-you-call-hapyak-a-platform" class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Why do you call HapYak a "Platform"?</h2>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">A platform is something you can build on top of. That's what HapYak is.
      <br>We provide a solid foundation of features, tools and API's out-of-the-box, but you can extend and customize every detail to make something entirely unique.

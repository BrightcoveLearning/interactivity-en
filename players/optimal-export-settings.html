    <p>HapYak works by playing, pausing, seeking to time on and syncing with your video player. Most of the time, there is nothing you'll need to alter from your normal production &nbsp;/ upload workflow to ensure optimal playback of your interactive video.<br><br>If you're looking for the best possible precision for your interactions <b>placing Key frames at the exact points you'd like to seek to or pause</b> is the ideal solution. You do this right before you export your video (from Adobe Media Encoder or Premiere Pro for example).<br><br>If you're looking for good rule-of-thumb export settings, they are:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Key Frame Interval</b>: 0.5 seconds</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Bitrate</b>: 5,000 - 10,000 kbps</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Codec: </b>h.264</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Facebook and Twitter do not support third-party interactive video technology. Best practice for sharing a HapYak project on Facebook or Twitter is to <b>share a link</b> to the web page where the video is embedded or to the HapYak landing page. This has the added benefit of directing traffic to your web properties. We recommend <b>adding a poster image of the video</b> to increase click through rate to the page.</p>

    <p class="intercom-align-left">xAPI / Experience API / Tin Can is not currently supported by HapYak.
      <a href="mailto:support@hapyak.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Email us</a> if this is a necessity for your interactive video projects and we can advise on options. Our customers have repeatedly asked us about this and the trend is clear, xAPI and Learning Record Stores (LRS) are on the rise as the preferred, flexible infrastructure for learning content, but this is an area where we've decided to not be on the "bleeding" edge. Our innovation is Interactive Video. Our goal for integrations is to reach the widest possible audience.&nbsp;

    <p>Currently, HapYak is not certified for screen readers and keyboards. We have had a handful of customers ask about this in the past but currently there are no defined plans for adding official support.</p>
    <p>The good news here is that, because HapYak is HTML5-based, many of the functionalities that are part of new accessibility regulations do work as hoped for. &nbsp;If you have more details on which internal or external regulations you are looking to satisfy please feel free to <a href="mailto:support@hapyak.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">email them along to us</a>. We'll add them to an existing ticket internally for a future product improvement so we can reference them at that time. </p>
    <p>If specific accessibility requirements are mandatory at your institution, feel free to email <a href="mailto:support@hapyak.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">support@hapyak.com</a> to review options. </p>

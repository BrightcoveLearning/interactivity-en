    <p class="intercom-align-left">HapYak is web-based software. You can not, as a standard workflow, download a HapYak project.
      <br>
      <br>The delivery of the project to viewers is by either A) sharing the landing page link or B) embedding in a web site, LMS, CMS, etc., just like you would with any other web video.
    </p>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">The one exception to this workflow is
      <a href="/sharing-and-embedding/publishing-to-an-lms.html" data-is-internal-link="true">downloading a SCORM package</a> of the video. If you are in eLearning, you will now exactly what this means. If not, then the less you know about SCORM, the better.
      <br>
      <br>If you have special considerations under which you normally upload and download your videos (for privacy, technical, logistical or other reasons)
      <a href="mailto:support@hapyak.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">email us</a> or ask us through intercom in the portal and we can help determine a solution.

    <p class="intercom-align-left">No. HapYak works with video that is streamed or played via an internet connection.</p>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">The viewers will need to have an internet connection to watch a video with HapYak annotations.</p>

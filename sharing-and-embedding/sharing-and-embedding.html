    <p>Sharing a project generates embed code or a URL so it can be seen by viewers. If you are publishing a Brightcove video, publishing and sharing should be done using a <a href="/getting-started/configuring-player-plugin.html">HapYak-enabled Brightcove Player</a> using the Media module in Video Cloud Studio. </p>
    <p>To share a project or experience, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Brightcove Interactivity Studio.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation, click <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click on a project or experience to open it.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">SHARE</span>.</li>
      <li>Select a <strong>Share Type</strong>.
            The following types are available:
          <ul>
              <li>HapYak Wrapper</li>
              <li>Landing Page</li>
              <li><a href="#embedly-link">Embed.ly Link</a></li>

    <h2 id="sharing-a-landing-page">Sharing a landing page</h2>
    <p>Sharing to a landing page will generate a  dedicated, static URL that any viewer can access. This is a quick and easy way to share your project with others, for example to get feedback from collaborators or clients or more broadly in an email, on Slack, or any other channel.</p>
    <p>To generate a landing page, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Brightcove Interactivity Studio.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation, click <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click on a project or experience to open it.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">SHARE</span>.</li>
      <li>For the <strong>Share Type</strong>, click <strong>Landing Page</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">GENERATE</span> to generate a landing page.</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/sharing-and-embedding/share-landing-page.png"> </figure>
    <p>If you would like to customize the landing page by adding a header, footer or social share icons for example, click <span class="button-blue">EDIT</span>. This will open the Experience Editor for  that video. Click <span class="button-blue">SETTINGS</span> and customize the social sharing and branding settings as needed.</p>

    <h2 id="embedding-a-hapyak-project">Embedding a  project</h2>
    <p>To embed a project or experience on your Website, CMS, or LMS, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Brightcove Interactivity Studio.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation, click <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click on a project or experience to open it.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">SHARE</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>First, click <b>Share</b>, then select HapYak Player or Native Player (Brightcove Player, Wistia Player, Vimeo Player, etc...)</p>
    <h3 id="hapyak-player-v-native-player">HapYak Player v. Native Player</h3>
    <p>HapYak Player is most commonly used player option. If you want your viewers to be able to watch the interactive video in <b>full screen</b> or if using an <b>iframe embed code</b> is necessary for embedding in your CMS, then HapYak Player is your best bet.</p>
    <p>Native player gives you a <b>javascript embed code</b> that allows for advanced integration and communication with the video. If you are a developer using advanced embed techniques or on-page communication with javascript then Native Player is your best bet.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="options">Options</h2>
    <h3 id="size">Size</h3>
    <p>We recommend the <b>Responsive</b> setting. This ensures that the embed will adapt to the height and width of the the parent element in which the video is embedded - the optimal viewing experience across all devices. </p>
    <p>Or select <b>Fixed Size</b> and enter specific dimensions. The lock icon locks the aspect ratio when you manually adjust the dimensions. A <b>Fixed Size</b> embed will always remain the same size and may only be partially viewable on some devices or in smaller browser windows. </p>
    <h3 id="controls">Controls</h3>
    <p>There are two options - HapYak Controls or Native Controls.</p>
    <p>Under <b>Use Videojs4 Controls</b> in the <b>Controls</b> panel, selecting <b>No</b> will enable use of the HapYak controls, and selecting <b>Yes</b> will activate the Native Controls.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The modern and responsive HapYak controls include <b>skip to annotation buttons</b>and <b>annotation markers</b>that enhance the interactive experience for the viewer, and a <b>full screen</b> button that ensures full screen support for the interactive video. </p>
    <p>An important benefit of HapYak controls is that unlike many player controls, they are persistent and below the video (rather than appearing on the video when the viewer hovers over with the mouse). This ensures that they do not get in the way of any viewer interaction.</p>
    <p>If you choose native controls, it will simply show the controls from your video player itself (Wistia, Vimeo, Brightcove, YouTube, etc....)</p>
    <h3 id="double-controls">Double Controls</h3>
    <p>If you use the HapYak <i>player,</i> you may see the native player <i>controls</i> in addition to the HapYak player controls. </p>
    <p>If you wish to remove the native player controls, you will want to obtain a " <b>chromeless</b>" version of your video from the <b>video source</b>. Then you can simply <a href="/projects/configuring-project-settings.html" data-is-internal-link="true">replace the video source</a> of the HapYak project. &nbsp; For help with your specific video player, email us at<a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com"> Brightcove Support</a> . </p>
    <h3 id="dom-element-native-playervideojs4-player-only">DOM Element (Native Player/VideoJS4 Player Only)</h3>
    <p>Naming the DOM element is for advanced users. This allows you to apply a custom id to the video element.</p>

    <h2 id="embedly-link">Embed.ly link</h2>
    <p> <a href="http://Embed.ly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Embed.ly</a> is a service that lets hundreds of systems and platforms (like Jive, Medium, reddit, Disqus, AOL, Digitas, Acquia, Trello, Udemy, etc...) make it easier for people to embed content (like interactive videos). </p>
    <p>Brightcove Interactivity is an Embedly provider. What this means is if your system supports Embedly, then all you have to do is copy and paste the Embedly link and it will figure out the rest and embed your Brightcove Interactivity project for you. </p>

    <h2 id="brightcove">Brightcove Player</h2>
    <p> When publishing to a Brightcove Player, it is recommended that you publish using the Media module in Video Cloud Studio.    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Make sure you have created a <a href="/getting-started/configuring-player-plugin.html">HapYak-enabled Brightcove Player</a>.</li>
      <li>Login to Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>Open the <strong>Media</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Select a video.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Publish and embed... Ë‡</span> &gt; <strong>Publish to web.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make sure you select a HapYak-enabled Brightcove Player. For more information, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/publish/publishing-videos-and-playlists-media-module.html">Publishing Videos and Playlists with the Media Module</a>.</p>

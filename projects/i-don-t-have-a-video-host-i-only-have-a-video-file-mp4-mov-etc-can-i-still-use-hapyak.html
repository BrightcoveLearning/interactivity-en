    <p>Absolutely! Simply ensure your video lives on a server that will give you a link to the URL of the file (like Amazon S3, Dropbox, etc...). <strong>Copy the link to the file, paste into a new project in HapYak</strong>. Select any open source video player from the "embed type" list, for example videoJS.</p>

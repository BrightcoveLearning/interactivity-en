    <p>When most LMSs and CMSs allow you to upload a file, they place it on a server so other users can see it. However, each one does it differently, so finding the URL might be a challenge. Please, send us an email <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com">Brightcove Support</a> directly and we'll help you locate where the file URL is located. </p>

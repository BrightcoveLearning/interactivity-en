      <li>In the HapYak portal, click " <strong>New Project</strong>".</li>
      <li>There are three ways users can upload video content to a project.
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the <strong>URL or Embed Code</strong>ï»¿ of your video and paste into HapYak </li>
          <li><strong>Upload</strong> a video file by dragging it from your desktop, or browsing your computer </li>
          <li><strong>Browse My Videos</strong> and select previously uploaded video files. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select an Embed type. This is usually the place where the video is hosted. &nbsp;If your URL is directly to a video file (ending in ".mp4" for example) select an open source player (like VideoJS).</li>
      <li>Enter a title and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should see the project load. If you get an error, click " <strong>New Project</strong>" again. Ensure that the URL, embed code, or file type of the video is a supported format. &nbsp;If you have trouble, or your video player is not listed, send us an email <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com">Brightcove Support</a>  and we'll add it to the list. </p>

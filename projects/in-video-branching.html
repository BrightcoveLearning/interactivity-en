    <p>Brightcove Interactivity offers two techniques for creating branching or &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; (CYOA) content.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Video to video branching</strong> - This technique uses a <a href="/experiences/creating-branching-experience.html">Branching Experience</a> where multiple videos are strung together. The viewer jumps from video to video using annotations.</li>
      <li><strong>In-Video branching</strong> - This technique uses a single video. The viewer jumps from poin to point in the <i>same video</i> using annotations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both work equally well, it's a personal preference based on your production process and how your videos are already produced.</p>

    <h2 id="sample">In-Video branching sample</h2>
    <p>The following is an example of in-video braching. The main menu &quot;page&quot; will loop until an image is clicked. Clicking an image will jump to that part of the video. When that part of the video is complete, a triggered action will send the video back to the main menu page. The &quot;Main Menu&quot; text is transparent overlay that displays throughout the video and will jump to the main menu when clicked.</p>
      <div style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 960px;"><div style="padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe src="https://players.brightcove.net/1752604059001/tTstQb2r7E_default/index.html?videoId=1740625459453837148" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>

    <p>Follow these steps to add branching to a project:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Brightcove Interactivity Studio.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation, click <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click on a project to open it.</li>
      <li>Add a chapter marker at each point in the video where a choice begins. The chapter markers will be invisible to viewers.</li>
      <li>For each &quot;choice point&quot;, add a text, image or transparent overlay annotation that the viewer will click on to jump to different parts of the videos. Make sure the start time and duration for each of these annotations is identical.</li>
      <li>On one of the choice annotations, set <strong>Action to take if the viewer doesn't click</strong> to <strong>Loop back</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/projects/in-video-branching/annotation-loop-back.png"> </figure>
        </li>
      <li>On each annotation set <strong>Link / Actions</strong> to <strong>Jump to video time </strong>and select the correct Chapter or enter a custom time.</li>
    </ol>

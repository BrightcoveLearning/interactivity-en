    <p class="intercom-align-left">Typically, videos are not directly uploaded to HapYak. Rather, videos remain where they always have been (an existing video host, locally hosted on a server, etc...). Users copy the link or embed code of the video and paste it into the "
      <strong>URL Or Embed Code</strong>" tab in the "
      <strong>New Project</strong>" menu on HapYak and then add annotations. If you don't have a video provider, we'd be happy to recommend one!&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p class="intercom-align-left">Alternatively, users can upload an .mp4 file directly to HapYak by choosing the "
      <strong>Upload</strong>" tab in the "
      <strong>New Project</strong>" menu and selecting the file on their system.&nbsp;

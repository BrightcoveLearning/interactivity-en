    <h2 id="create">Creating a new project</h2>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Brightcove Interactivity Studio.</li>
      <li>In the primary navigation, click <strong>Create</strong> and then <span class="button-blue">NEW PROJECT</span> or click <strong>Manage</strong>, click the <strong>Projects</strong> tab and then click <span class="button-blue">New Project</span>. </li>
      <li>There are three ways users can upload video content to a project.
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the <strong>URL or Embed Code</strong>ï»¿ of your video and paste into Brightcove Interactivity Studio</li>
          <li><strong>Upload</strong> a video file by dragging it from your desktop or browsing your computer </li>
          <li><strong>Browse My Videos</strong> and select previously uploaded video files</li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/projects/create-projects/choose-video-dialog.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Select an <strong>Embed type</strong>. This is usually  where the video is hosted. &nbsp;If your URL is directly to a video file (ending in ".mp4" for example) select an open source player (like Video.js).</li>
      <li>Enter a title and click <span class="button-blue">Next</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should see the project load. If you get an error, click <span class="button-blue">New Project</span> again. Ensure that the URL, embed code, or file type of the video is a supported format. &nbsp;If you continue to have trouble, or if your video player is not listed, send an email to <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com">Brightcove Support</a> and we'll add it to the list.</p>

    <h2 id="copy">Copying projects</h2>
    <p>On the list of projects, hover over the right side of the project and click the copy icon (<img src="/assets/images/projects/icon-copy.png">). </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/projects/create-projects/project-list.png"> </figure>
    <p>This will create an exact clone of the project including all annotations, tags, and custom CSS, titled "Copy of {project_name}".</p>
    <p>This is a great way to save time when creating new projects that are similar to ones already created. Simply change the video source of the new cloned project and adjust the annotations as needed.</p>
    <h3 id="copy-different-group">Copying a project into different group</h3>
    <p>Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtkSC34ioJyL_mFOEjBvCFcME5gkb7eheAV96rx2IOrMENVQ/viewform" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this Form</a>. Brightcove Support will copy the project in our back end and email you back confirmation when it's complete.</p>

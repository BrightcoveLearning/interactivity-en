    <p>Branching and Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) video is easy with HapYak. We offer two methods.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users can create branching videos using the <strong><a href="http://kb.hapyak.com/experiences/branching-experience" data-is-internal-link="true">Branching Experience</a></strong> (where <strong>multiple videos</strong> are strung together - similar to how other expensive custom interactive video technologies work). The viewer jumps from video to video using annotations.</li>
      <li>You can create <strong>In-Video</strong> branching (where all scenarios are edited together in one "Supercut"). The viewer jumps from point to point in the <i>same video</i> using interactions. Examples <a href="https://corp.hapyak.com/examples/nutanix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://corp.hapyak.com/room4media/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both work equally well, it's a personal preference based on your production process and how your videos are already produced.</p>

      <li>Create a <strong>New Project</strong> in HapYak.</li>
      <li><strong>Add Chapters</strong> for each point in the video where a choice begins (don't worry, these are invisible to the viewer).</li>
      <li>For each <strong>Choice Point</strong>, add <strong>hotspot, text or image</strong> annotations that the viewer will click on to jump to different parts of the videos. Make sure the start time and duration for each of these is identical.</li>
      <li>On <i>one</i> of the choice annotations. Set "Action to take if the viewer doesn't click" to loop back.</li>
      <li>On each annotation set <strong>Link / Actions</strong> to <strong>Jump to video time </strong>and select the correct Chapter or enter a custom time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on just 2 or 3 choices at each choice point. This is much easier for the viewer to process and results in higher interaction rates.</li>
      <li>Make sure each choice point lasts for at least 10 seconds.</li>
      <li>Add bumpers (sections of white or black or motion graphics) between the different choice sections to ease the transition. We recommend about 5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Always allow the viewer to return to the choice points. You'll be surprised at how many viewers want to watch a branching video over and over again. To do so, simply add a text or image annotation that links back to the choice point.</li>
      <li>Optional Pro Tip: Continue the audio track underneath the choice points and bumpers. This creates a more seamless experience for the viewer.</li>
      <li>Super Pro Tip: You can even track how viewers are experiencing the branching video and <a href="/custom-annotations/branching-advanced-customization.html" data-is-internal-link="true">trigger actions based on those paths</a>.</li>

        <p>Branching and Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) video is easy with HapYak. We offer two methods.</p><p>Users can create branching videos using the <strong><a href="http://kb.hapyak.com/experiences/branching-experience" data-is-internal-link="true">Branching Experience</a></strong> (where <strong>multiple videos</strong> are strung together - similar to how other expensive custom interactive video technologies work). The viewer jumps from video to video using annotations.</p>
        <p>Or you can create <strong>In-Video</strong> branching (where all scenarios are edited together in one "Supercut"). The viewer jumps from point to point in the <i>same video</i> using interactions. Examples <a href="https://corp.hapyak.com/examples/nutanix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://corp.hapyak.com/room4media/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Both work equally well. it's a personal preference based on your production process and how your videos are already produced.</p>
        <h2 id="branching-experience">Branching Experience</h2>

        <ol>
          <li><p>Create a <strong>New Project</strong> in HapYak.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Add Chapters</strong> for each point in the video where a choice begins (don't worry, these are invisible to the viewer).</p></li>
          <li><p>For each <strong>Choice Point</strong>, add <strong>hotspot, text or image</strong> annotations that the viewer will click on to jump to different parts of the videos. Make sure the start time and duration for each of these is identical.</p></li>
          <li><p>On <i>one</i> of the choice annotations. Set "Action to take if the viewer doesn't click" to loop back.</p></li>
          <li><p>On each annotation set <strong>Link / Actions</strong> to <strong>Jump to video time </strong>and select the correct Chapter or enter a custom time.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Focus on just 2 or 3 choices at each choice point. This is much easier for the viewer to process and results in higher interaction rates.</p></li>
          <li><p>Make sure each choice point lasts for at least 10 seconds.</p></li>
          <li><p>Add bumpers (sections of white or black or motion graphics) between the different choice sections to ease the transition. We recommend about 5 seconds.</p></li>
          <li><p>Always allow the viewer to return to the choice points. You'll be surprised at how many viewers want to watch a branching video over and over again. To do so, simply add a text or image annotation that links back to the choice point.</p></li>
          <li><p>Optional Pro Tip: Continue the audio track underneath the choice points and bumpers. This creates a more seamless experience for the viewer.</p></li>
          <li><p>Super Pro Tip: You can even track how viewers are experiencing the branching video and <a href="/custom-annotations/branching-advanced-customization.html" data-is-internal-link="true">trigger actions based on those paths</a>.</p></li>
